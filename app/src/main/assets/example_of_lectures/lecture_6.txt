So far, the programs you've seen have run in a straight line. But what if you want your program to
make decisions? This is where conditional statements come in.

A conditional statement is a programming construct that allows a program to execute different pieces of
code based on whether a condition is true or false.

\bold The Concept of True and False in C

In C, there is no built-in bool (boolean) data type by default (it was introduced later in C99 with the
<stdbool.h> header). Instead, C uses integers to represent truth values:

    False is represented by the integer 0.

    True is represented by any non-zero integer (1, -1, 100, etc.).

This is a fundamental concept in C. When we talk about "conditions," we are often referring to control
flow statements. Control flow is the order in which the instructions in your program are executed.

\bold The if Statement

The simplest form of a conditional statement uses the if keyword.

If the condition inside the parentheses is true (evaluates to a non-zero value), the code within the
block is executed. Otherwise, the program skips it and continues.

c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    if (1) { // 1 is non-zero, so this is always true
        printf("This text will always be displayed.\n");
    }

    int isDark = 1; // Any non-zero value means "true"
    if (isDark) {
        printf("Yep, it's dark now!\n");
    }

    isDark = 0; // 0 means "false"
    if (isDark) {
        printf("This text is NEVER printed!!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c

In C, any expression that evaluates to a non-zero value inside an if statement (or loop) is
considered true. Only zero is considered false. This is very convenient. For example, to check if a
divisor is valid, you don't necessarily have to write:

c
if (divider != 0) {
    // some code
}
c

You can simply write:
c
if (divider) { // This is true if 'divider' is any number except 0
    // some code
}
c
This principle simplifies code and is a fundamental part of C programming.

\bold The if-else Statement

You can extend the if statement with an else clause to provide an alternative action when the condition is false.

If the condition is true, the first block of code is executed. If it is false, the block following the
else is executed. Both blocks cannot be executed together.
c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int numerator, denominator;
    printf("Let's divide the numbers, enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &numerator, &denominator);

    if (denominator) { // Check if denominator is not zero
        printf("The result is: %d\n", numerator / denominator);
    } else {
        printf("Unfortunately, the divisor is 0. Cannot divide.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c
\bold Chaining Conditions with else if

For checking multiple conditions, you can chain if and else statements together using else if
c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    if (number == 1) {
        printf("Number is 1\n");
    } else if (number == 2) {
        printf("Number is 2\n");
    } else if (number == 3) {
        printf("Number is 3\n");
    } else if (number == 4) {
        printf("Number is 4\n");
    } else {
        printf("Number is not 1, 2, 3, or 4\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c
Output Example:
Enter a number: 89
Number is not 1, 2, 3, or 4

\bold The Ternary Operator (? :)

Often in programming, you need to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. For example:
c
if (a > b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}
c
C provides a shorthand for this common pattern: the ternary operator. It is a compact form of an
if-else statement that returns a value.
The general syntax is:
c
result = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
c
Here is the same assignment using the ternary operator:
c
max = (a > b) ? a : b;
c
This code is more concise. Let's break it down:

    The condition (a > b) is evaluated.

    If the condition is true, the expression evaluates to a.

    If the condition is false, the expression evaluates to b.

    The result is then assigned to max.

Complete Example:
c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // The ternary operator returns a value. We use it directly in printf.
    // Note: We use the integer format specifier %d and print the corresponding string.
    printf("The number is %s\n", (number % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd");

    return 0;
}
c

A More Complex Example (Nested Ternary):
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);

    // Compare a and b
    const char *result;
    if (a == b) {
        result = "equal";
    } else {
        if (a > b) {
            result = "greater";
        } else {
            result = "less";
        }
    }
    printf("The first number is %s than the second.\n", result);

    // This can be written with a nested ternary operator, but use with caution for readability:
    // printf("The first number is %s than the second.\n",
    //        (a == b) ? "equal" : (a > b) ? "greater" : "less");

    return 0;
}
c

\bold The Golden Rule of Good Programming

"Write clean and readable code."

If the ternary operator makes your code simpler and easier to understand (as in the "even/odd" example),
use it. If it makes the logic more confusing and nested (as in the more complex comparison), the
if-else construct is almost always the better choice. Clarity should be your top priority.
