\bold What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple Boolean expressions (conditions) to form more complex
conditions. They return either 0 (false) or 1 (true) based on the logical relationship between the operands.
The Three Fundamental Logical Operators

\bold Logical AND (&&)

The AND operator returns true (1) only if both conditions are true.

Truth Table:
c

A     B     A && B
0     0       0
0     1       0
1     0       0
1     1       1
c

Practical Example:
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    int has_license = 1; // 1 represents true

    if (age >= 18 && has_license) {
        printf("You are legally allowed to drive.\n");
    } else {
        printf("You cannot drive legally.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c

Output:
text

You are legally allowed to drive.

\bold Logical OR (||)

The OR operator returns true (1) if at least one of the conditions is true.

Truth Table:
c

A     B     A || B
0     0       0
0     1       1
1     0       1
1     1       1
c

Practical Example:
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char day = 'S';

    if (day == 'S' || day == 's') {
        printf("It's the weekend! Time to relax.\n");
    } else {
        printf("It's a weekday. Back to work!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c

\bold Logical NOT (!)

The NOT operator reverses the truth value of a condition. It returns true (1) if the condition is false,
and false (0) if the condition is true.

Truth Table:
c

A     !A
0      1
1      0
c

Practical Example:
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int is_raining = 0; // 0 represents false

    if (!is_raining) {
        printf("The weather is good. You can go outside!\n");
    } else {
        printf("It's raining. Better stay indoors.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c
Output:
text

The weather is good. You can go outside!

\bold Combining Multiple Operators

You can create complex conditions by combining multiple logical operators. Use parentheses to make the
order of evaluation clear.

Example: Student Grade Checker
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int score = 85;
    int attendance = 90;

    // Student passes if score >= 60 AND attendance >= 75
    // OR if they have a perfect attendance (100)
    if ((score >= 60 && attendance >= 75) || attendance == 100) {
        printf("Student passes the course.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Student fails the course.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c

\bold Operator Precedence and Parentheses

Understanding operator precedence is crucial when combining operators:

Order of Evaluation (Highest to Lowest):

    ! (Logical NOT)

    && (Logical AND)

    || (Logical OR)

Good Practice: Use parentheses to make your intentions clear, even when they're not strictly necessary.
c

// Clear with parentheses
if ((temperature > 30 && humidity > 80) || is_heatwave) {
    printf("Extreme weather warning!\n");
}

// Less clear without parentheses
if (temperature > 30 && humidity > 80 || is_heatwave) {
    printf("Extreme weather warning!\n");
}
c
\bold Short-Circuit Evaluation

C uses short-circuit evaluation, which means it stops evaluating as soon as the result is known:

    AND (&&): If the left operand is false, the right operand is never evaluated

    OR (||): If the left operand is true, the right operand is never evaluated

Example Demonstrating Short-Circuit:
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 10;

    // Due to short-circuit, (y/x) is never evaluated because x == 0 is false
    if (x != 0 && y/x > 2) {
        printf("This will never execute.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Safe due to short-circuit evaluation!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c

\bold Practical Programming Examples

Example 1: User Authentication System
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char username[] = "admin";
    char input_username[20];
    int input_password = 12345;

    printf("Enter username: ");
    scanf("%s", input_username);

    printf("Enter password: ");
    scanf("%d", &input_password);

    // Check if both username AND password are correct
    if (strcmp(input_username, username) == 0 && input_password == 12345) {
        printf("Login successful! Welcome, admin.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Invalid username or password. Access denied.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
c
Example 2: Number Validation
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Check if number is in valid range (1-100) but not 50
    if (number >= 1 && number <= 100 && number != 50) {
        printf("Valid number entered: %d\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("Invalid number! Must be between 1-100 and not equal to 50.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Example 3: Leap Year Checker
c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int year;

    printf("Enter a year: ");
    scanf("%d", &year);

    // Leap year rules:
    // Divisible by 4 AND (not divisible by 100 OR divisible by 400)
    if ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)) {
        printf("%d is a leap year!\n", year);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a leap year.\n", year);
    }

    return 0;
}
c
\bold Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Pitfall 1: Using Bitwise Operators by Mistake
c

// Wrong - using bitwise AND instead of logical AND
if (x & y) { ... }  // Bitwise AND

// Correct - using logical AND
if (x && y) { ... } // Logical AND
c

Pitfall 2: Confusing Assignment (=) with Comparison (==)
c

// Wrong - this assigns 5 to x, then checks if 5 is true (which it always is)
if (x = 5) { ... }

// Correct - this compares x with 5
if (x == 5) { ... }
c

Best Practice: De Morgan's Laws
When negating complex conditions, use De Morgan's Laws:

    !(A && B) is equivalent to !A || !B

    !(A || B) is equivalent to !A && !B

c

// Complex condition
if (!(age < 18 || has_license == 0)) {
    // This is hard to read
}

// Simplified using De Morgan's Laws
if (age >= 18 && has_license != 0) {
    // Much clearer!
}
c

\bold Summary

    && (AND): Both conditions must be true

    || (OR): At least one condition must be true

    ! (NOT): Reverses the truth value

    Use parentheses for complex expressions

    Remember short-circuit evaluation

Logical operators are fundamental to creating intelligent, decision-making programs. Master them, and you'll
be able to handle any complex condition your programs might encounter!
