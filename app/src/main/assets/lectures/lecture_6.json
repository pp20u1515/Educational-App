  "content": "So far, the programs you've seen have run in a straight line. But what if you want your program to\nmake decisions? This is where conditional statements come in.\n\nA conditional statement is a programming construct that allows a program to execute different pieces of\ncode based on whether a condition is true or false.\n\n\\bold The Concept of True and False in C\n\nIn C, there is no built-in bool (boolean) data type by default (it was introduced later in C99 with the\n<stdbool.h> header). Instead, C uses integers to represent truth values:\n\n    False is represented by the integer 0.\n\n    True is represented by any non-zero integer (1, -1, 100, etc.).\n\nThis is a fundamental concept in C. When we talk about \"conditions,\" we are often referring to control\nflow statements. Control flow is the order in which the instructions in your program are executed.\n\n\\bold The if Statement\n\nThe simplest form of a conditional statement uses the if keyword.\n\nIf the condition inside the parentheses is true (evaluates to a non-zero value), the code within the\nblock is executed. Otherwise, the program skips it and continues.\n\nc\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    if (1) { // 1 is non-zero, so this is always true\n        printf(\"This text will always be displayed.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    int isDark = 1; // Any non-zero value means \"true\"\n    if (isDark) {\n        printf(\"Yep, it's dark now!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    isDark = 0; // 0 means \"false\"\n    if (isDark) {\n        printf(\"This text is NEVER printed!!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\nIn C, any expression that evaluates to a non-zero value inside an if statement (or loop) is\nconsidered true. Only zero is considered false. This is very convenient. For example, to check if a\ndivisor is valid, you don't necessarily have to write:\n\nc\nif (divider != 0) {\n    // some code\n}\nc\n\nYou can simply write:\nc\nif (divider) { // This is true if 'divider' is any number except 0\n    // some code\n}\nc\nThis principle simplifies code and is a fundamental part of C programming.\n\n\\bold The if-else Statement\n\nYou can extend the if statement with an else clause to provide an alternative action when the condition is false.\n\nIf the condition is true, the first block of code is executed. If it is false, the block following the\nelse is executed. Both blocks cannot be executed together.\nc\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int numerator, denominator;\n    printf(\"Let's divide the numbers, enter two numbers: \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &numerator, &denominator);\n\n    if (denominator) { // Check if denominator is not zero\n        printf(\"The result is: %d\\n\", numerator / denominator);\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Unfortunately, the divisor is 0. Cannot divide.\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\\bold Chaining Conditions with else if\n\nFor checking multiple conditions, you can chain if and else statements together using else if\nc\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    printf(\"Enter a number: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &number);\n\n    if (number == 1) {\n        printf(\"Number is 1\\n\");\n    } else if (number == 2) {\n        printf(\"Number is 2\\n\");\n    } else if (number == 3) {\n        printf(\"Number is 3\\n\");\n    } else if (number == 4) {\n        printf(\"Number is 4\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Number is not 1, 2, 3, or 4\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\nOutput Example:\nEnter a number: 89\nNumber is not 1, 2, 3, or 4\n\n\\bold The Ternary Operator (? :)\n\nOften in programming, you need to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. For example:\nc\nif (a > b) {\n    max = a;\n} else {\n    max = b;\n}\nc\nC provides a shorthand for this common pattern: the ternary operator. It is a compact form of an\nif-else statement that returns a value.\nThe general syntax is:\nc\nresult = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;\nc\nHere is the same assignment using the ternary operator:\nc\nmax = (a > b) ? a : b;\nc\nThis code is more concise. Let's break it down:\n\n    The condition (a > b) is evaluated.\n\n    If the condition is true, the expression evaluates to a.\n\n    If the condition is false, the expression evaluates to b.\n\n    The result is then assigned to max.\n\nComplete Example:\nc\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number;\n    printf(\"Enter a number: \");\n    scanf(\"%d\", &number);\n\n    // The ternary operator returns a value. We use it directly in printf.\n    // Note: We use the integer format specifier %d and print the corresponding string.\n    printf(\"The number is %s\\n\", (number % 2 == 0) ? \"even\" : \"odd\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\nA More Complex Example (Nested Ternary):\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b;\n    printf(\"Enter two numbers: \");\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    // Compare a and b\n    const char *result;\n    if (a == b) {\n        result = \"equal\";\n    } else {\n        if (a > b) {\n            result = \"greater\";\n        } else {\n            result = \"less\";\n        }\n    }\n    printf(\"The first number is %s than the second.\\n\", result);\n\n    // This can be written with a nested ternary operator, but use with caution for readability:\n    // printf(\"The first number is %s than the second.\\n\",\n    //        (a == b) ? \"equal\" : (a > b) ? \"greater\" : \"less\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\n\\bold The Golden Rule of Good Programming\n\n\"Write clean and readable code.\"\n\nIf the ternary operator makes your code simpler and easier to understand (as in the \"even/odd\" example),\nuse it. If it makes the logic more confusing and nested (as in the more complex comparison), the\nif-else construct is almost always the better choice. Clarity should be your top priority.",
