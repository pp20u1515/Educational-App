  "content": "Pointers are an essential tool in C programming that allows us to manipulate memory addresses and access data indirectly. They provide us with powerful mechanisms for memory management, creating dynamic data structures, and optimizing program efficiency.\nThere is a belief that pointers are quite difficult to understand and can cause errors even for experienced programmers. But you just need to be a little more careful with them.\nHowever, once you grasp their concepts and learn how to use them effectively, you will unlock new possibilities in your programming journey.\n\n\\bold Address-of operator (&)\n\nWhen a variable is initialized in C, it is automatically allocated a free memory address. It stores any value you assign to the variable. For example: int age = 32; When the processor executes this statement, it allocates a portion of the computer's memory with a specific address (let's say 0x3093cea98). At that moment, the variable becomes associated with that memory address.\nIn previous topics, you saw how to obtain the address of an object in C. This is done using the address-of operator (&). The address-of operator (&) allows us to determine the memory address assigned to a specific variable. It's quite simple:\n\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int age = 32;\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", age);        // prints the value of the variable (32)\n    printf(\"%p\\n\", (void*)&age); // prints the memory address of the variable (0x3093cea98)\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\nBy using the address-of operator, you can access the memory address of variables, which is a fundamental concept when working with pointers in C.\n\n\\bold Pointers\n\nOkay, I have a variable age with a value and now even its memory address. Can I store the address itself in a variable? Almost. In C, there is another fundamental data type called a pointer, specifically designed for storing memory addresses.\nIn C, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows us to indirectly access and manipulate data by referring to its memory location. Pointers provide flexibility and efficiency in memory management. They enable us to work with dynamic data structures, pass arguments by reference, and interact with low-level operations.\nPointers are declared similarly to regular variables but with an asterisk * between the data type and the identifier:\n\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number = 11;        // our variable\n    int *ptr = &number;     // and this is a pointer to the address of our variable\n\n    printf(\"value of number: %d\\n\", number);\n    printf(\"address of number: %p\\n\", (void*)&number);\n    printf(\"pointer content: %p\\n\", (void*)ptr); // the address of our variable stored in a pointer\n\n    double pi = 3.14;\n    double *piptr = &pi;\n\n    printf(\"value of pi: %f\\n\", pi);\n    printf(\"address of pi: %p\\n\", (void*)&pi);\n    printf(\"pointer content: %p\\n\", (void*)piptr); // the address of our variable stored in a pointer\n\n    // attempt to put the address of an int variable into a double pointer\n    // double *newptr = &number; // ERROR: incompatible pointer types\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 It is important to remember that a pointer must be of the same data type as the object it points to.\n\n    if int n; then int *iptr = &n;\n\n    if double m; then double *dptr = &m;\n\nHow much memory is needed to store types like int or double? Does a pointer to these types also occupy space (after all, you need to store the memory address somewhere)? The sizeof() operator has the answers to these questions:\n\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number = 11;\n    int *ptr = &number;\n\n    printf(\"int size: %zu\\n\", sizeof(number));\n    printf(\"ptr to int size: %zu\\n\\n\", sizeof(ptr));\n\n    double pi = 3.14;\n    double *piptr = &pi;\n\n    printf(\"double size: %zu\\n\", sizeof(pi));\n    printf(\"ptr to double size: %zu\\n\", sizeof(piptr));\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\nIn our case, you get the following result:\n\nc\n\nint size: 4\nptr to int size: 8\n\ndouble size: 8\nptr to double size: 8\nc\n\nSo what's the point? For the double type, the memory size occupied by the variable and the pointer is the same, but for the int type, the pointer is twice as big. Yes, the advantage isn't particularly noticeable for basic data types, but the size of a pointer is always fixed (since you only store the address and nothing more). This is where the main advantage of a pointer lies: you can have an object of any size somewhere, even 1GB, and without passing the entire object around your program, you can always manipulate a pointer to its memory address.\nThe size of a pointer in C can vary across computer systems, depending on the underlying architecture. It is typically equal to the native word size, such as 4 bytes on a 32-bit system or 8 bytes on a 64-bit system. However, variations in pointer size exist, especially with different computer architectures or specialized systems. Consider these variations when writing C code for portability and compatibility.\nOkay, so a pointer stores the address, but can you somehow retrieve the value from it? Of course, for that, use the dereference operator (*) with a pointer.\n\n\\bold Dereference operator (*)\n\nWhen you dereference a pointer, it means getting the value that is stored at the memory address it points to. You do it using the dereference operator (*). Dereferencing allows you to read or modify the value at that memory location:\n\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int number = 11;\n    int *ptr = &number;\n\n    printf(\"value of number: %d\\n\", number);\n    printf(\"address of number: %p\\n\", (void*)&number);\n    printf(\"pointer content: %p\\n\", (void*)ptr); // the address of our variable stored in a pointer\n\n    // Aaaand...\n    printf(\"Value at the address pointed to by ptr: %d\\n\", *ptr); // Dereference the pointer\n\n    *ptr = 39; // Change the value at the address pointed to by ptr\n    printf(\"New value of number: %d\\n\", number); // number has also changed\n\n    return 0;\n}\nc\n\nUnderstanding the dereference operator is crucial when working with pointers in C. It enables us to access and manipulate data indirectly, giving us powerful capabilities in memory management and data manipulation.\n\n\\bold Null pointers\n\nPointers can be very tricky (more than variables) because you can declare them without initializing them (in which case the pointer will point to an unknown area of memory). You need to be extremely careful because a pointer can point to something you don't intend to change, and you won't be able to verify it. Below is a syntactically valid code example, but it can potentially lead to significant issues if you attempt to write something using such a pointer.\n\nc\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int *ptr; // Declared but not initialized\n\n    // Print the value of the pointer 'ptr' (can be any garbage address)\n    printf(\"%p\\n\", (void*)ptr);\n\n    // Dereference and print the value (Undefined Behavior if uninitialized!)\n    // printf(\"%d\\n\", *ptr); // DANGEROUS! Don't do this!\n\n    // Write a value to the memory location pointed to by 'ptr' (potential critical errors)\n    // *ptr = 100; // DANGEROUS! Where are we writing the data? Might break the OS!\n\n    // Print the \"updated\" value (undefined behavior due to previous potential errors)\n    // printf(\"%d\\n\", *ptr); // DANGEROUS!\n\n    return 0;\n}// In practice, this code may behave differently, but most often will lead to a crash (Segmentation fault).\nc\n\nTo safeguard yourself, you can use a null pointer. A null pointer is a special value that indicates it is not pointing to any valid memory address. You can assign it explicitly using the value NULL (defined in stdio.h or stddef.h).\n\nc\n\nint *ptr = NULL; // assigning NULL to the pointer\nc\n\n\uD83D\uDCA1 Null pointers are dangerous because they do not point to a valid memory location. When you dereference a null pointer, that is, when you try to access the memory location it points to, it leads to undefined behavior. This can result in crashes (segmentation fault), program termination, unpredictable results, or memory corruption if the null pointer is mistakenly used to read from or write to memory.\nIt is crucial to handle null pointers appropriately to avoid crashes and undefined behavior in the program. Always check if a pointer is NULL before dereferencing it.",
